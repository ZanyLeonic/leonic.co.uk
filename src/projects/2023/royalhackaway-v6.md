Royal Hackaway v6 was a hybrid event that took place on February 4th and 5th 2023.

**Responsibilities I had during the event;**

- Helped to setup camera equipment and network to stream to a central server to stream to Twitch.tv from a single desk
- Updated and maintained the node-cg stream overlay
- Coach and help newer or inexperience participants

\
**Responsibilities I had outside the event;**

- As treasurer, allocated funds for food, equipment, banners, etc. without going over budget
- Maintained and updated the RHUL Computing Society, and Royal Hackaway websites, both using TypeScript, Gatsby with MDX
