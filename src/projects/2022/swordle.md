This was the project that me and group of RHUL students created at [Royal Hackaway v5 (archived)](https://archive.daemondemon.co.uk/royalhackaway/v5/).

This project won 2nd place.

After we met and introduced ourselves to each other, we brainstormed for project ideas. We came up with an idea of a multiplayer competitive version of Wordle as it was extremely popular at the time.

Due to our different backgrounds and levels of experience, we all played to our strengths and knowledge with toolchains we are familiar with to complete the task.

We decided to make it web based to make it as accessible as possible for people to play and demo.

My contributions on the project:

- Game server communication with frontend (via WebSockets)
- Deploying and provisioning the server on the cloud
