Royal Hackaway v6 was a hybrid event that took place on February 4th and 5th 2023.

**Responsibilities I had during the event;**
* Helped to setup camera equipment and network to stream to a central server to stream to Twitch.tv from a single desk
* Updated and maintained the node-cg stream overlay
* Coach and help newer or inexperience participants

\
**Responsibilities I had outside the event;**
* As treasurer, allocated funds for food, equipment, banners, etc. without going over budget
* Maintained and updated the RHUL Computing Society, and Royal Hackaway websites, both using TypeScript, Gatsby with MDX
